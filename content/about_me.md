I'm Dung, a passionate embedded developer. My journey into the realm of technology began at Can Tho University, where I pursued my degree in Software Engineering, graduating ahead of schedule.

During my college days, I enjoyed developing Arduino, and then ESP8266 projects with sensors and actuators. This hands-on experience has honed my skills in software development, specializing in crafting efficient solutions tailored to the unique demands of embedded systems and IoT applications.
 
When I was doing my thesis, I had the privilege of participating in a national project focused on developing a water observing system for pangasius farming ponds in Binh Phu Industrial Park. This project provided a unique opportunity to apply my area of expertise in the agricultural sector.
