I'm Dung, a passionate embedded developer. My journey into the realm of technology began at Can Tho University, where I pursued my degree in Software Engineering, graduating ahead of schedule.

During my college days, I enjoyed developing Arduino, and then ESP8266 projects with sensors and actuators. This hands-on experience has honed my skills in software development, specializing in crafting efficient solutions tailored to the unique demands of embedded systems and IoT applications.
